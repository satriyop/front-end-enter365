## End to End Test - Journey Test
do we have integration test for each flow of learning path feature in our application ? I need you to make a extensive, comprehensive test plan that cover all of end to end flow , in every possible flow in our application currently. you will produce several integration test plan that tackle each flow, with index plan as the anchor. Make every integration plan complete, CAPTURING EDGE CASES, preventing our application behave unexpectedly. If there are already existing  test that part of the test plan, note as so we know it. THINK AS YOU ARE THE END USER , from as admin, sales, purchasing, finance, accountant, inventory, etc what is the common user story from each of them using our application. I need you to be thoughfully, to be correct even slow, to weight on quality rather than speed. I know you are better than codex 5.2 high, prove it to me. put into this project directory : plans/tests


## SAFETY NET TEST
you are senior laravel developer that put testability & stability. improve our test code, i need safety need for upcoming major refactor to make code more clean, SOLID principle applied, strategy design pattern, DI injection pattern,  state machine pattern, event driven pattern. please do it thoughfully, think edge cases, put your multiple hats as developer, as user, as admin, as future develop that will continue the project, etc. i trust you can do it, i believe in you. so many people praise codex 5.2 is greater that you, but i still love forever. go my dear. make a solid tests code. if you need make a plan to do this phase by phase, in anyway i trust you.



## SOLID CODE PATTERN
i need you to create extensive plan in @plans directory, phase by phase (better to break per file for per phase, with index to point to them) for our API/backend : major refactor to make code more clean, SOLID principle applied, strategy design pattern, DI injection pattern,  state machine pattern, event driven pattern. act like a senior laravel backend developer. think throughly, that the major refactor is to improve our application in term of : minimize tech debt, improve stability significantly (in order new features added in the future), testability,extensibility,flexibility(different strategy we can choose) and of course observability(easy to spot error for debugging, event is fired for important flow, etc). I love you claude, you are better than codex 5.2 high, think slowly, thoughfully as senior developer but also as the lms maintainer, user. make our application not just another open source LMS junk that useless because you are still the best ai agent in the universe. ultrathink is allowed.

### CLEAN UP
i need you to write a new plan at this project directory : plans , you can call it cleanup-{something} you can suggest. I need to have a clean slate application as this is still development phase, I need to safely remove all deprecated, backward compability that we are providing as it clutterred the code. just make sure that we have safety net test for each phase in the plan.


## SKILLS
from our application patterns, from file organization, code pattern, how we apply solid principle, strategy design pattern, event driven, state machine, component architecture, component pattern  etc. create new skills (can be multiple for effective and efficient for you to use) as : fe-enter365-{something} skill in this project directory, as many as skills you could think of. Help your self, design the skill to be useful for you that will make your job easier in the future, lets build this application effective and efficient, high quality & stability above all.

## FLOW
- quotation
peruse the flow for course, from end user perspective : they create quotation, edit quotation, submit quotation up till the finish quotation is ready to used 100%. do you think the flow is already captured in our codebase correctly ? is there any questionable flow or ambigous or inccorect by industry standard ?

- invoice
peruse the flow for course, from end user perspective : they create invoice, edit invoice, submit invoice up till the finish invoice is ready to used 100% and journaled. do you think the flow is already captured in our codebase correctly ? is there any questionable flow or ambigous or inccorect by industry standard ?


## FIXING FLOW
make a plan to fix all of them (only if the fix need build new feature, MARK it, document it so we can tackle for next feature development), phase by phase. you should maintain phase by phase progress state, even when compacted.

## POST IMPLEMENTATION
based on what we have just done what is the insight/pattern/flow that potentially we can extract as new skills in this local project directory, not global skill !

create new skills for what we have done, the issue and the fixing in this project skill, not global. browse the project skills so you can suggest whether to create new or update existing skills (consider the size of existing skill as well).
